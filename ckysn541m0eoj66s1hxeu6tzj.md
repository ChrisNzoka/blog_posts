# Technical Writing: Six Reasons You Should Write Technical Articles

## 1\. Overview

**Technical writers acquire or provide technical information for professional use**. Also, technical writers must structure and present information in a way that makes it readable, clear, and useful.

In this article, **we'll learn six reasons why we should write technical documents**.

## 2\. Why Technical Writing?

Of course, there are several ways to pass information to a specified audience. However, technical writing is one of the easiest and quickest ways to do so.

**Technical writing has grown to become a necessity as more people seek an economical and quick way to learn.**

Currently, it is essential to develop technical writing skills. This skill would help professionals in technical fields provide online help through:

* technical manuals
    
* software tutorials
    
* handbooks
    
* technical guides
    

Let's see some reasons why we should learn technical writing.

### 2.1. Sharing Knowledge

Technology is ubiquitous. **The majority of experts today learned what they know from others who were willing to share their knowledge.**

From courses (paid and free) to tutorials and tips shared on various platforms including **FreeCodeCamp**, **Hashnode**, **Medium**, et cetera.

Further, this act of sharing helps in the following ways:

* makes information easily accessible to learners
    
* enhances quick learning through well-written guidelines
    
* reduces the time and energy wasted in the search for solutions to everyday problems
    

Hence, **we should consider sharing what we already know or learned through technical writing**. We can find out how to get started as we read on.

### 2.2. Documenting our Learning Process

Now, let's recall going back to review the scripts and codes we wrote while learning to code. We become appreciative of how swiftly we've grown.

Similarly, **technical writing affords us the chance to document our progress in learning**. It also aids in keeping track of everything else we've learned while attempting to break into a technical profession.

Perhaps we couldn't get to making videos and spending time editing them. However, **we can easily write out our opinion on any subject matter.**

```markdown
**Hey, don't wait! Start now!**
```

Now, how do we cement what we've learned?

### 2.3. Learning From Teaching

**Have you ever doubted your own knowledge?** **One way to dispel our skepticism is to teach the subject.** There and then, we'll be in a position to evaluate ourselves and reinforce our knowledge on that topic.

**Technical writing provides the opportunity to learn and teach.** In fact, I didn't know half of the content of this article until I researched, learned, and shared it with you.

**Writing encourages us to study and pick up new skills**. Plus, it offers the ideal opportunity to learn more on the subject and improve our learning abilities.

**Writing is the perfect assurance that we know what we know.**

### 2.4. Becoming a Subject Matter Expert

**Instead of depending on subject matter experts for everything, we can become subject matter experts ourselves.**

> Subject matter experts, also called SMEs, are professionals who have advanced knowledge in a specific field. As an authority in a particular area or topic, they are uniquely qualified to provide guidance and strategy.

For a variety of reasons, it makes sense for technical writers to establish themselves as experts in their industry. We will gain the respect of other professionals in our sector. We even get to have informative conversations with them.

Further, **it is easier for us to evaluate the accuracy of the information we read or receive as subject matter experts.**

Writing also provides others with the certainty that our content is accurate. This is so, even if subject matter specialists have not thoroughly reviewed it. However, the case is different for those who neither write nor teach.

Certainly, **technical writing is the right path to becoming a subject matter expert**. We can read further on the [steps to become a subject matter expert](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/subject-matter-expert).

### 2.5. Earning Passive Income

Indeed, we can make good money writing technical articles. By creating helpful content, technical writers can earn a lot of money.

Most experts began producing technical content to supplement their income and advance their careers. Since many platforms will pay to post our writings on their networks, this is a possibility. Additionally, **businesses employ technical writers full-time to produce and maintain technical documentation.**

### 2.6. Scaling Through Interviews

Notably, **the documents and content we post online help us become more visible on the internet**. Recruiters are continuously searching for qualities that set a candidate apart as the best one for a position.

Say I applied for the *senior technical writer* role for *Google Cloud* at Google. In addition to that, I have written close to a hundred articles about *Google Cloud*. The recruiters can readily utilize that to assess my expertise on the subject. In fact, it can even elevate me to the level of subject matter expert on Google Cloud.

Thus, **let's consider waving our pens as we learn**. All it'll take is for someone to admire our effort.
